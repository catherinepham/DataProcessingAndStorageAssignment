# Assignment Feedback

The complexity level of this assignent was very reasonable and doable. To improve this assignment, the documentation could be more clear about the development of the in memory class by hinting that we would need to implement our own data structure along with the required functions. Additionally, there were a few typos and syntax errors in the Java code that was provided in the document. To make it easier to grade this assignment, the TA's should create JUnit test cases and provide that file to the students.
